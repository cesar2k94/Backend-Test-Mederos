# Backend-Test-Mederos (Challenger Cornershop ðŸ¥‘)

The project consists of the creation of a lunch menu created by an administrator. Two types of users (administrator and employees) have access to the application. The administrator can create the menu, modify it and see the orders that each worker has made. Employees can request a menu option and specify customizations of the option, the order must be made before 11:00 am. SQLite is used as the relational database.

* **Users app:** users are identified and new users of the type employees are created.
